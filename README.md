### Hey! 
My name's Nate, I use he/him pronouns, and I'm a Computer Science Major at the University of Vermont.
Most of my github includes a few different small projects I'm doing during my own time to either challenge my skills or give back to my community. 

Currently having fun with website development here. For more info, head over to my website to find some of my ongoing web development projects: https://www.natelalor.com.
