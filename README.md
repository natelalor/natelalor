### Hey! 
My name's Nate and I graduated from the University of Vermont with a Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science. Here are a few of my many CS projects I've done. A combination of school projects, personal projects, and community projects, this place is for me to show what I've done and what I am currently doing.

Want to learn more? You're in luck! Head over to my website to find some of my ongoing web projects, as well as some extra fun stuff I've put together just for you: https://www.natelalor.com.
