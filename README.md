### Hey! 
My name's Nate, I use he/him pronouns, and I'm a Computer Science Major at the University of Vermont. Here are a few of my many CS projects I've done. A combination of school projects, personal projects, and community projects, this place is for me to show what I've done and what I am currently doing.

Interested in more of my web development projects? You're in luck! Head over to my website to find some of my ongoing web projects: https://www.natelalor.com.
